# ML pipeline to classify heart sound (2025)
This repository contains the implementation of an end-to-end signal processing and machine learning pipeline for classifying heart sound recordings into one of three categories: Healthy, Murmur, or Artifact.

ML_pipeline.ipynb : Python implementation of the machine learning pipeline, written in a Jupyter Notebook. Each cell is modular and can be run independently to perform specific tasks such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The cells should be run in consecutive order from top to bottom.
